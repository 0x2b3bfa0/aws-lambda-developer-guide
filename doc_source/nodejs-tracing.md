# Instrumenting Node\.js Code in AWS Lambda<a name="nodejs-tracing"></a>

In Node\.js, you can have Lambda emit subsegments to X\-Ray to show you information about downstream calls to other AWS services made by your function\. To do so, you first need to include the [the AWS X\-Ray SDK for Node\.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-nodejs.html) in your deployment package\. In addition, wrap your AWS SDK `require` statement in the following manner\.

```
const AWSXRay = require('aws-xray-sdk-core')
const AWS = AWSXRay.captureAWS(require('aws-sdk'))
```

Then, use the AWS variable defined in the preceding example to initialize any service client that you want to trace with X\-Ray, for example:

```
const s3 = new AWS.S3()
```

After following these steps, any call made from your function using `s3Client` results in an X\-Ray subsegment that represents that call\. As an example, you can run the Node\.js function following to see how the trace looks in X\-Ray\.

**Example index\.js**  

```
const AWSXRay = require('aws-xray-sdk-core')
const AWS = AWSXRay.captureAWS(require('aws-sdk'))
const s3 = new AWS.S3()

exports.handler = async function(event) {
  return s3.listBuckets().promise()
}
```

Following is what a trace emitted by the code preceding looks like\.

There are up to three subsegments generated by traced Lambda functions, all of which are pictured above.

* **Initialization**: This subsegment is only generated for "cold-start" requests to Lambda, and it represents the amount of time Lambda spends bootstrapping your execution environment prior to executing your function code. To learn more about cold starts, see [AWS Lambda Execution Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-context.html).
* **Invocation**: This subsegment is always generated and represents the amount of time spent executing your function code.
* **Overhead**: This subsegment is always generated and represents the amount of time that elapses from when your function code finishes executing to when AWS Lambda is ready to process another request.
