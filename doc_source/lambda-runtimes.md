# AWS Lambda Runtimes<a name="lambda-runtimes"></a>

AWS Lambda supports multiple languages through the use of runtimes\. You choose a runtime when you create a function, and you can change runtimes by updating your function's configuration\. The underlying [execution environment](current-supported-versions.md), which is shared by all runtimes, provides additional libraries and environment variables that you can access from your function code\.

When your function is invoked, Lambda attempts to re\-use the execution environment from a previous invocation if one is available\. This saves time preparing the execution environment, and allows you to save resources like database connections and temporary files in the [execution context](running-lambda-code.md) to avoid creating them every time your function runs\.

A runtime can support a single version of a language, multiple versions of a language, or multiple languages\. Runtimes specific to a language or framework version are [deprecated](runtime-support-policy.md) when the version reaches end of life\.
