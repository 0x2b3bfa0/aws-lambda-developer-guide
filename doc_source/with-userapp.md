# Using AWS Lambda with Custom User Applications<a name="with-userapp"></a>

One of the use cases for using AWS Lambda is to process events generated by a user application\. For demonstration purposes, you don't need to write a user application that invokes your Lambda function\. Instead, the tutorial provided in this section provides sample event data that you can use and then you invoke your Lambda function manually\.

When a user application invokes a Lambda function, it's an example of the AWS Lambda *request\-response* model in which an application invokes a Lambda function and receives a response in real time\.

For a tutorial that walks you through an example setup, see [Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda with Custom User Applications](with-userapp-walkthrough-custom-events.md)\.
