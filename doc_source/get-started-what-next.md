This Getting Started exercise provided you with an overview of how to use the AWS Lambda console\. 

AWS Lambda functions can also be automatically invoked in response to events in other AWS services such as Amazon S3 and DynamoDB\. Lambda functions can also be invoked on\-demand over HTTPS\. You can also build your own custom event sources and invoke Lambda functions on demand\. 

Depending on your integration scenario, whether your application needs event\-driven Lambda function invocation or on\-demand invocation, see the following sections:

+ [Using AWS Lambda with Amazon S3](with-s3.md)

+ [Using AWS Lambda with Kinesis](with-kinesis.md)

+ [Using AWS Lambda with Amazon DynamoDB](with-ddb.md)

+ [Using AWS Lambda with AWS CloudTrail](with-cloudtrail.md)

+ [Using AWS Lambda with Amazon API Gateway \(On\-Demand Over HTTPS\)](with-on-demand-https.md)

+ [Using AWS Lambda as Mobile Application Backend \(Custom Event Source: Android\)](with-on-demand-custom-android.md)

The console provides several blueprints for you to set up example Lambda functions quickly that can process events from these event sources\. You may want to explore other blueprints in the console to get started with Lambda functions triggered by these event sources\.
